echo "Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens."
echo "It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not."
echo "What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!"
echo "He that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom."
